The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and semantic-versioning.
---

## [1.5.1] – 2025‑06‑17

### Changed

- **Documentation menu styling** - Removed border bottom from each table header and re-adds it to the wrapping
  table-header. This removes annoying spaces between table headers.

---

## [1.5.0] – 2025‑06‑15

### Added

- **IntelliJ 2024.1+ documentation API support** with rich popups and fallback for older builds.
- **Dynamic value-table columns** – documentation now auto-adds *px Eq.*, *Hex* and *WCAG* columns when relevant.
- **Recursively/derived variable completions** are now marked with (↗).
- **Improved DebugImportResolution helper** for tracing variable origins and import chains.
- **Legend for derived variables** – documentation now includes an explanation of the ↗ symbol when variables are
  resolved through imports or references.

### Changed

- **Completions and docs cascading logic** – now use the last value per context (cascading logic).
- **Improved context labeling** – media query parsing, color handling, and documentation rendering.
- **Centralized index versioning** – improved caching, and greater maintainability.
- **Winner-first documentation** – the actual winning value is now shown first in documentation tables for immediate
  clarity.

### Fixed

- **CSS cascade compliance** – local declarations now correctly override imported values, following proper CSS cascade
  rules.
- **Minor bugs in arithmetic resolution** for preprocessors.
- **Improved context collapsing** – color parsing, and documentation bugs.
- **Improved UX hierarchy** – better visual distinction between winning values (bold) and overridden declarations.

---

## [1.4.2] – 2025‑06‑12

### Added

- **Preprocessor variable index**: LESS and SCSS variables are now indexed for instant look‑ups using a new
  `PreprocessorVariableIndex`.
- **Value-based completion sorting**: Variable completions are sorted by their numeric value, with an option to choose
  ascending or descending order.
- **Pixel equivalent column**: Variable documentation now shows the pixel equivalent for rem/em/%/vh/vw/pt values.
- **Settings UI for sorting**: Added a configuration option to choose value-based variable sorting order (ascending or
  descending).
- **Comprehensive value-type utilities**: Added `ValueUtil` for classifying, comparing, and converting variable values
  for size, color, and number types.
- **Smarter context ranking**: Added `RankUtil` for logical sorting and ranking of context labels (e.g., default,
  min-width).
- **Extensive automated tests**: Added `ValueUtilTest` and `RankingTest` for robust value handling and context ranking.

### Changed

- **Improved performance and scope caching**: Variable key cache and scope caching now use stable, scope-aware maps for
  reliable completion and documentation.
- **Smarter var() detection**: Completion now works while typing incomplete `var(` and resolves aliases more quickly,
  even with missing parenthesis.
- **Documentation improvements**: Documentation tables conditionally display pixel equivalents and improved context
  sorting, with more robust and readable HTML output.
- **Refactored preprocessor resolution**: Preprocessor variable resolution is faster and now leverages the new index
  instead of scanning files directly.
- **Improved logging and error handling**: More robust cancellation checks and error reporting in completion and
  documentation providers.
- **Code cleanup**: Removed legacy and duplicated code, improved code comments, and enhanced maintainability.

### Fixed

- **Scope caching race conditions**: Caches for variable keys and preprocessor scopes are now properly invalidated and
  synchronized on changes, preventing duplicate completions and stale results.
- **Duplicate IDE completions**: Improved completion logic eliminates repeated suggestions.
- **Robustness**: Improved handling of edge cases in value parsing, prefix extraction, and context detection.
- **IDE startup and indexing**: Now compatible with latest IntelliJ indexing and plugin APIs.

### Removed

- Legacy file scan-based preprocessor variable resolution logic (now replaced by index-based resolution).
- Unused or obsolete code in tests and main sources.

---

## [1.4.1] – 2025‑06‑05

### Improved

* Completion suggestions load faster with a project-level cache of variable names.
  The cache is cleared whenever the index is rebuilt.

---

## [1.4.0] – 2025‑06‑02

### Changed

* **New defaults:** indexing scope now defaults to **GLOBAL** and **maxImportDepth** is **20** (was 10).
* Legacy settings are clamped to the new 1–20 range on load.
* Settings dialog pre‑selects **Global scope** on first run.

### Fixed

* LESS/SCSS alias chains ending in arithmetic expressions now resolve to their literal values (e.g.
  `--less-variable-spacing--md → 24px` not `--less-variable-spacing--md → @less-variable-spacing-md`).
* Minor NPEs in completion popup when evaluating invalid pre‑processor refs.

### Migration notes

Existing users keep their previous scope; switch manually via **Settings → Tools → CSS Variables Assistant** or hit *
*Reset to Defaults** to adopt the new behaviour.

## [1.3.1] – 2025-05-28

### Added

* **Enhanced Debug CSS Import Resolution** action – comprehensive import chain analysis with tree visualization,
  variable counting, and detailed resolution paths.
* **Dedicated completion cache** (`CssVarCompletionCache`) – separate caching system for LESS/SCSS variable resolution
  with improved performance.
* **Index rebuilder utility** (`CssVariableIndexRebuilder`) – centralized index management for better code organization.
* **Dynamic completion popup width** – automatically adjusts popup width based on longest variable name for better
  readability.
* **Enhanced progress reporting** – detailed progress indicators for re-indexing operations with step-by-step feedback.

### Changed

* **Code architecture improvements** – extracted cache and index management into dedicated utility classes for better
  maintainability.
* **Re-index process enhancement** – more detailed progress reporting with visual feedback and error handling.
* **Import resolution debugging** – comprehensive analysis shows full import trees, variable counts, and resolution
  failures.

### Fixed

* **Cache management** – resolved issues with stale cache entries affecting completion accuracy.
* **Index rebuilding reliability** – improved error handling and progress tracking during index operations.
* **Threading improvements** – better handling of background tasks and cancellation scenarios.
* **Memory optimization** – more efficient cache management reducing memory footprint.

## [1.3.0] – 2025-05-27

### Added

* **Dynamic pre-processor resolution** – fully resolves chained `@/ $/ --` references across LESS, SCSS, SASS & CSS,
  even inside imported packages.
* **Import-cache** – remembers every file reached through `@import`, giving instant look-ups after the first index pass.
* **🔄 Re-index Now** button – available in **Settings → Tools → CSS Variables Assistant**. Rebuilds the index without "
  Invalidate Caches / Restart".
* **Debug CSS Import Resolution** context-menu action – prints the exact chain of resolved `@import`s for the selected
  file.
* **IDE progress integration** – all long-running tasks are cancellable (Progress Manager).

### Changed

* **New default maxImportDepth** ⇢ `10` (was `3`).  
  Still user-configurable.
* **Icons** – always use the plugin shield for variables originating from the assistant, regardless of scope.
* **Scope utilities** – `ScopeUtil.effectiveCssIndexingScope()` and `currentPreprocessorScope()` consolidated; always
  compute a fresh scope for resolution paths.

### Fixed

* **Project + Imports scope** now resolves real values (e.g. `--theme-primary → #1a73e8`) instead of showing the
  intermediate `@lessVar`.
* Missing completions when switching from *Project Only* to *Project + Imports* without restarting.
* Race condition that occasionally produced `ProcessCanceledException` in large projects.
* Import-depth recursion guard respected across mixed preprocessor stacks.
* Global scope no longer double-indexes the same node_modules files.

---

## [1.2.0] – 2025‑05‑22

### Added

* **Advanced** `@import` resolution: intelligent resolution of `@import` statements across `CSS`, `SCSS`, `SASS`, and
  `LESS` files.
* **Smart** node_modules handling: properly resolves scoped packages like @company/package/path.
* **Configurable** indexing scope: choose between `project‑only`, `project + imports`, or `full global` indexing via
  Settings.
* **Import depth control:** configurable **maximum depth** for `@import` chains to **prevent** infinite recursion.
* **Enhanced settings panel:** fine‑tune plugin behavior with expanded configuration options under
  `Settings → Tools → CSS Variables Assistant`.

### Improved

* **Multi‑extension support:** automatically tries `.css`, `.scss`, `.sass`, `.less` extensions when resolving imports
  without explicit extensions.
* **Relative path resolution:** better handling of `./` and `../` import paths with proper extension priority based on
  importing file type.
* **Performance optimizations:** smarter file filtering and caching for **faster completion** suggestions in large
  projects.
* __Error handling:__ improved stability when processing malformed import statements or missing files.

### Fixed

* Import resolution now correctly distinguishes between relative paths and node_modules packages.
* Deprecated API usage replaced with modern IntelliJ Platform APIs.
* Better handling of circular import dependencies with visited file tracking.
* Improved compatibility with latest WebStorm/IntelliJ versions.

## [1.1.0] – 2025‑05‑19

### Added

- **Alias resolution:** `--alias: var(--real);` now resolves to the literal value in completion & docs.
- **Duplicate squashing:** identical `(context,value)` pairs collapse into one row.
- **Smart sorting in docs:** order is Default / Light → Dark → `max‑width` (desktop‑first, large → small) →
  `min‑width` (mobile‑first, small → large) → other media queries.
- **Light counts as primary:** `prefers-color-scheme: light` is treated the same as `default`.
- **Stricter index filter:** template/text files are ignored.

### Changed

- Completion “type text” mirrors the new smart order.
- Documentation shows context values instead of “(+N)” when context display is enabled.
- `DoubleColorIcon` now appears even when light/dark values alias to colours.

### Fixed

- No more duplicate “Default” rows for repeated declarations with the same value.
- Docs no longer show raw `var(--xyz)` when it can be resolved.
- Colour swatches & WebAIM links work for resolved aliases too.

## [1.0.2] – 2025‑05‑19

### Added

- **Settings page:** Plugin is now user-configurable (toggle context-based variable values).
- **Smarter completions:**
    - Dual color swatch if a variable has both light and dark color values.
    - All original value syntaxes shown (e.g., `#fff`, `hsl(0 0% 100%)`, `rgb(…))`).
    - Context-aware completions: e.g. “🌙” for dark mode, no overlays.
- **Color swatches:**
    - Now supports **shadcn/ui** color variables format, `--foreground: 0 0% 100%;`.
- **Robust comment parsing:** All major CSS comment styles now supported for variable docs (JSDoc, plain, single-line,
  multiline).
- **Context tracking:** Indexer now properly tracks context (media queries, dark/light, nested queries, etc).
- **Documentation enhancements:**
    - Multi-context variables shown as a table.
    - Color swatches always use original value syntax.
    - WebAIM contrast checker link for color variables.

### Changed

- **Consistent UI:**
    - No overlay/context icons on completion swatch—context info is right-aligned only.
    - Completions/docs now fully respect user settings.

### Fixed

- **Comment parsing bugs:** One-line, multi-line, and mixed-format doc-comments now always recognized.
